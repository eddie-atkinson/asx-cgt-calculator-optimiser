        This is a simple calculator that helps with record-keeping for your ASX holdings,
        and calculation of CGT when selling.
        <br /><br />
        All care has been taken to ensure that the calculations made here are correct and that they
        conform to ATO requirements (as at 2021-07-10). I trust this calculator enough to use it for record-keeping
        and CGT calculations of my own portfolio. However, I make no guarantee that the calculator is free from defects and accept
        no liability for any consequences incurred by you of issues herein. Always check any values calculated here against
        your own calculations.
        <br /><br />
        If you find any issues with the calculator, please raise them <a href={`${repoUrl}/issues`}>here</a>.
